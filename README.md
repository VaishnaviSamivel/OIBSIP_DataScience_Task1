OIBSIP Data Science Task 1 - Iris Flower Classification

Task Objective
Build a Machine Learning model that classifies iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their petal and sepal measurements.

---

 Dataset Used
- The Iris dataset from **Scikit-learn**
- Features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width
- Target: Species (0 - setosa, 1 - versicolor, 2 - virginica)

---

 Steps Performed
1. Loaded the Iris dataset using `sklearn.datasets`
2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Visualized feature relationships using pair plots and heatmaps
4. Preprocessed data (Train-test split and scaling)
5. Trained a Logistic Regression model
6. Evaluated model with accuracy and confusion matrix

---

 Tools Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

 Outcome
- Achieved high accuracy in classifying the iris species
- Built a basic but effective ML pipeline for classification
